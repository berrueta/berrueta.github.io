My name is Diego Berrueta. I'm a software engineer, space enthusiast and hiker.

In the past I have also done some research work in the area of the Semantic Web and Linked Data.
Please check my old website for a [list of research activities and publications][research].

I have been involved in free software / open source since 1997, when I co-founded AsturLinux, a
local Linux user group in Asturias, Spain. Please check my old website for [details of my past free software activity][freesoftware].
These days I am less involved, but I still have a few open source projects in my [Github][github] and [Bitbucket][bitbucket] accounts.

I'm a very active hiker, and I also practice kayaking, camping and biking.
