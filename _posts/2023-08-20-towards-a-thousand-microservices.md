In 2019 I prepared a talk about Atlassian's journey into the world of microservices. At that time the company had around 1,000 microservices running in production, and I thought the story was worth sharing.

I delivered the talk a few times in some Meetup groups in Sydney, and then a few more times at Universidad de Oviedo and Universidad Carlos III de Madrid.

The recordings in English and Spanish are available below. The [slides][slides] are also available.
